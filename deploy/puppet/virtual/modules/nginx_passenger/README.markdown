## Puppet Nginx Passenger Module

This is a fork of [puppet-nginx-passenger](https://github.com/jrabary/puppet-nginx-passenger) to install nginx with
passenger using default ruby version on debian wheezy or ubuntu precise.

After inclusion, this module ensures that any user in group `www-data` is able to deploy through tools such as capistrano or mina, this of course as long as you have right ssh configuration (keys or forwarding) in place.

This module installs Nginx using [puppet-rvm](https://github.com/maestrodev/puppet-rvm/). Please, read the documentation before you begin. This module has been tested on Ubuntu Precise (12.04). For custom types, do not forget to enable pluginsync:
```puppet
[main]
pluginsync = true

```

### Basic usage

Install nginx_passenger with

```puppet
include nginx_passenger
```

By default installs on _/opt/nginx_, there are some variables you might override

```puppet
class {'nginx_passenger':
    ruby_version      => 'ruby-1.9.3-p125',
    passenger_version => '4.0.23',
    installdir        => '/opt/nginx',
    logdir            => '/var/log/nginx',
    www               => '/var/www',
}
```

A custom installation might look like this:

```puppet
node webserver {
    class { 'nginx_passenger':
      installdir => '/usr/local/nginx',
      logdir     => '/usr/local/logs/nginx',
    }
}
```

An advanced installation using nginx source would look like the following. Take a look at the [pagespeed module](http://forge.puppetlabs.com/kbatra/nginx_pagespeed) for help with downloading the source.
```puppet
class { 'nginx_passenger':
    nginx_source_dir => '/home/vagrant/nginx-1.4.2',
    nginx_extra_configure_flags =>  '--add-module=/home/vagrant/ngx_pagespeed-release-1.6.29.5-beta'
}
```

### Virtual Hosts

You can easily configure a virtual host. An example is:

```puppet
nginx::vhost { 'www.example.com':
	port => '8080'
	rails => true,
}
```
The _rails_ attribute is optional and set to false by default. However, if you want to deploy a rails app, use this attribute and the rails template will be used instead.

### SSL

You can enable SSL for a virtual host like so:

```puppet
nginx_passenger::vhost { 'www.example.com': 
  ssl  => on,
  ssl_certificate  => '/etc/ssl/example.crt',
  ssl_certificate_key => '/etc/ssl/example.key',
  ssl_default_server => true    # optional, to set this as default SSL server
}
```
