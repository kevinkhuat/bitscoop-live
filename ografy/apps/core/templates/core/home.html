	<div class="lockwidth centered">
		<p>We're currently in closed beta and taking some time to improve our products based on early feedback.</p>

		<p>
			We'll be enabling access to users on a first-come-first-served basis.
			When you're account is granted access you'll be able to participate in the early-stage testing of our products.
			Constructive feedback will be rewarded with invitations that you can send to your friends who may then bypass the wait period.
		<p>

		<p>We're excited to have you with us and will be enabling your account as soon as we can.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions please don't hesitate to <a href="{% url 'core_contact' %}">contact us</a>.</p>

		<p>Best wishes,</p>
		<p>The Ografy team</p>
