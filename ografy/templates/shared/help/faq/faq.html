		<div class="grow">Why can't I re-estimate locations more often?</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content-drawer">
		<p>
			Re-estimating the locations of Events is computationally expensive; it requires iterating through each one of your Events, finding the ones that are estimated, then for each of those finding one or two locations closest to it in time so that an estimation can be made.  With each user having hundreds or thousands of Events, allowing everyone to re-estimate as much as they want would become taxing on our servers.
