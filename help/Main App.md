# How to use the main page

## Accessing the main page
Click the circular BitScoop logo in the upper left corner of the screen.


## Using the map

### Selecting an Event
Clicking on an Event will open a sidebar with more information about that Event. 
Clicking on the event again will de-select the event and close the sidebar, as
will clicking somewhere on the map where there isn't an Event.

### Event Clustering
The map will automatically cluster Events together if, at the current zoom
level, they are too close together. Zooming in far enough will usually
de-cluster them unless you are at the maximum zoom level. If this is the case,
click on the cluster to make the individual Events appear.


## Searching Your Data

### How to Perform a Search
Click the magnifying glass at the top of the screen to perform a search based on
whatever criteria are currently selected. The map will update with the results
of the search.

### Changing the Search Criteria
To change the search criteria, click the filter button located between the text
box and the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen. This will open a
menu allowing you to change what types of Events are searched and add filters to
each type. Clicking on the icon to the left of each Event type will add or
remove that type from the search. Clicking the + to the right of each type will
add a filter on that type.

### Filters
Filters limit the data that is returned from a search and apply only to the
Event type that they were created on.

### Search Bar
Enter text in the search bar to find Events relating to those terms.


## Result List

### Sorting the Results
Click on the order icon in the lower-right corner of the screen to bring up a
menu with different methods to sort your results. Click on a method to sort by
it. Click on it again to sort in reverse order.

### Pagination
Only 100 results can be returned at one time. To access further results from a
search, click the left or right arrow in the lower right corner of the screen.
