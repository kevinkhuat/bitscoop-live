## Profile
The Profile page is where you can update your name, Username/Handle, and email
address. These fields update automatically without having to press any buttons.


## Security

### Change Password
Enter a new password in both text fields and click the button to change your
password.


## Location

### Location Estimation
If allowed, BitScoop can collect your location at a set interval. This location
information is used to better estimate Events from your accounts that do not
have coordinates. By default this is turned off. To turn it on, click the
checkbox labeled "Collect Location Information."

### Estimation Method
You can choose how BitScoop will estimate the coordinates of Events that are
lacking that information. Click on one of the options to select it.

### Re-Estimate Locations
Click the button to have BitScoop re-estimate the locations of your Events that
do not have coordinates of their own. This will use the Estimation Method
selected above. You are limited to running this at least 5 days after the most
recent estimation.

collected will still be accessible.

### Delete Signal

that signal and all data collected from it.

### Permissions
