# Account Settings


## Profile
The Profile page is where you can update your name, Username/Handle, and email
address. These fields update automatically without having to press any buttons.


## Security

### Change Password
Enter a new password in both text fields and click the button to change your
password.


## Location

### Location Estimation
If allowed, BitScoop can collect your location at a set interval. This location
information is used to better estimate Events from your accounts that do not
have coordinates. By default this is turned off. To turn it on, click the
checkbox labeled "Collect Location Information."

### Estimation Method
You can choose how BitScoop will estimate the coordinates of Events that are
lacking that information. Click on one of the options to select it.

### Re-Estimate Locations
Click the button to have BitScoop re-estimate the locations of your Events that
do not have coordinates of their own. This will use the Estimation Method
selected above. You are limited to running this at least 5 days after the most
recent estimation.


## Connections

### Overview
Click the box for each connection to show its settings.

### Turn Connection On or Off

is deactivated, no new data will be collected from it, but any data that was
collected will still be accessible.

### Delete Connection
Press the X to display a confirmation. Select Yes on the confirmation to delete
that connection and all data collected from it.

### Connection Name
Enter a new name in the text field to change the name of that connection.

### Permissions
Uncheck the box next to a permission to prevent BitScoop from collecting
information of that type from that connection.  Any data of that type already
collected will not be deleted.
