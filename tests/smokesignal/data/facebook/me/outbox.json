Mom tells me to leave you alone, but I decided to give this a try anyway.\n\nProbably nothing I can say will mean much right now, but I need to say it anyway.  In fact, this is probably a supremely bad idea.  \n\nI am at Dad’s again, and it reminds me that life has been harder on you than me.  There has been things that the family and I have done to you that we need to apologize for.  So, on behalf of all of us, I want to offer my deepest apology.  I guess I think of the problems of our family as hurdles and tests to overcome.\n\nI feel really isolated in DC and sometimes long for personal and family connections.  I think of my girlfriend’s siblings and Mark and I wish things were different.  If you are up for it, I could use a conversation with you every once in a while.  It doesn’t have to be immediate, I can wait until you are ready.\n\ni love you, I am sorry, and I beg you to help me rebuild this totally shattered relationship.  If there is anything I can do for you, I am happy to help out.\n\nBest Wishes,\n-Your Brother",
