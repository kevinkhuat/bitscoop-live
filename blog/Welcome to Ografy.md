Ografy is now open to the world. In the years that we've been working on Ografy, the biggest question that's come up is
a simple one: what is Ografy?

Ografy is an intelligent new way to get more out of all the time you spend online no matter what your goals are. You
will be able to search and explore your information wherever it is. We're still in closed beta, so we have a little ways
to go.

Ografy's co-founders have been kicking around the developer tools of internet applications and services for as long as
they've existed. In that time, we've learned that meaningful connections can come out of the data you create.

Many companies spend a lot of their time collecting data and intelligently conveying it to advertisers. This makes sense
for their business and it gets you many services for less money (or even for free). We're focused on using similar
technology but instead getting that information to you.

At Ografy we try to be as much of a community as a company. We're committed to our vision to do something different
online with transparency and accountability. We think the best way to achieve this is to have a shared set of values
with our customers and that it's our responsibility to let you know what those values are.

Ografy is a chance to do something different online. We believe experiences on the web are best when they are built
around your connection to the world. Our dream is to profoundly enhance this connection.
